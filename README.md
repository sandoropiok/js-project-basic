## Description

The **Pokémon Search Engine** is a web application that allows users to search for their favorite Pokémon and view detailed information about them in a beautifully styled card reminiscent of the iconic Pokémon trading cards. Leveraging the power of the **Pokémon API** and the **Fetch API**, this project provides a seamless and interactive user experience while displaying essential Pokémon details like name, image, stats, abilities, and more.

Designed with a responsive layout and vibrant styling, this project combines modern web development techniques with a nostalgic Pokémon-inspired design.
